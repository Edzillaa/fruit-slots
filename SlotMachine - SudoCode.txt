MARTINS HELP.

1. Load the spin button into javascript (this is called caching). Ex: let spinBtnEl = document.getElementById('spin-btn')
2. Load the reset button into javascript (this is called caching). Ex: let resetBtnEl = document.getElementById('reset-btn')
3. Load the score div into javascript (this is called caching). Ex: let scoreDivEl = document.getElementById('score-div')
4. Load the slots divs into javascript (this is called caching). Ex: let slotEls = document.querySelectorAll('.slot')
5. Assign an array of things (maybe emojis?) to a variable. Ex: const options = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
6. Add an event listener to spinBtnEl (on click). This event listener needs to be tied to a callback function, maybe handleSpin?
7. Define handleSpin with a function declaration: 
Ex: 
function handleSpin(evt) {
 ...write your code here
}
 a. Choose three random entries from options array and assign them to three variables.
 b. Check to see if the three entries match. If they do, your score goes up by 50 points. If they don't match, you lose 3 points.
 c. If your score is 0, game over.
8. Define render with a function declaration:
Ex:
function render() {
  ...write your code here
}
 a. All slots need to be filled with the three random entries. 
 b. The new updated score should be shown on screen!
 c. If they lose, show game over.
9. Define reset with a function declaration:
Ex: 
function reset() {
  ...write your code here
}
 a. Reset points to 50.
 b. Reset slot elements to display three 3 question marks.
